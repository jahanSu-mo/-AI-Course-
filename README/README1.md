# ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Course

Welcome to my AI Course Repository. This repository contains all my work completed throughout the Artificial Intelligence course, including algorithm implementations, AI games, and tool-based explorations.


## üìå Purpose of This Course

The purpose of this course is to provide a foundational understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts, problem-solving techniques, and real-world applications. It combines both theoretical knowledge and hands-on lab tasks to build practical skills in designing intelligent systems.


## üìö What I Learned from This Course

Throughout the course, I gained knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- Importance, Applications, and Goals of AI  
- Intelligent Agents and Environments  
- Problem-solving using various **search algorithms** (BFS, DFS, A*, Hill Climbing, etc.)  
- Solving classic problems like **8-Puzzle**, **N-Queen**, **CSP**  
- Game playing strategies using **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta pruning**  
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems and various **consistency techniques**  
- Knowledge Representation and **Propositional & Predicate Logic**  
- Machine Learning types: **Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning**  
- Handling uncertainty using **Bayesian Networks**  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP), **PageRank Algorithm**, and **AI in Robotics**  
- Implementing and building **AI-based games** (Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Car Racing)
- Exploring AI Tools for video creation and presentation design
